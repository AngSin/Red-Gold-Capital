          Red Gold Capital is offering a 3-month Business Analyst Internship to intelligent and resourceful individuals who have a keen interest in Private Equity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first order of business is to identify key target industries, carry out due diligence, assemble a Board of Directors and write the Private Placement Memorandum.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once complete, you will also be actively involved in the deal making process, from reaching out to investors, to organising and attending meetings with accountants and corporate lawyers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please bear in mind due to the early nature of the firm, this is an unpaid internship, however the environment of a start-up provides an unrivalled opportunity to expand oneâ€™s skill-set and to gain experience across all the processes within Private Equity.
        </p>
        <p>
